# 🖱️ Universal AutoClicker

**🧠 Smart, Recordable & Cross-platform AutoClicker**

---

## 📋 Overview

Universal AutoClicker is a powerful automation tool that lets you **record** and **replay mouse and keyboard actions** with precise timing. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, it's perfect for GUI testing, repetitive tasks, automation, or even gaming.

> 🧠 Unlike basic auto-clickers, this app captures real-time human interactions and saves them as portable macros (.json files).

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Mouse + Keyboard **input recording** (clicks, key presses/releases)
- 🔁 **Loopable playback**: once, multiple times, or infinitely
- 💾 **Save/Load actions** to/from `.json`
- ⏹️ **Emergency Stop** via **`S` key**
- 💡 **User-friendly GUI** with `tkinter`
- 📜 **Logging support** with timestamped `.log` files
- ⚙️ **Dist version available**: `dist/UniversalAutoClicker.exe` is a ready-to-use Windows executable

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🧪 Option 1: Python source (cross-platform)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Solendris/Universal_Autoclicker.git
   cd Universal_Autoclicker

## 💻 Option 2: Windows Executable (No Setup Required)

Navigate to the `dist/` folder and run the application: **dist/UniversalAutoClicker.exe**

✅ **No Python installation required** — ready to use instantly on Windows!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Records **mouse clicks** and **keyboard input** (press + release)
- Stores actions with exact timestamps using `mouse`, `keyboard`, and `pyautogui`
- Playback precisely mimics recorded actions including real-time delays
- Optionally, you can **save actions as `.json` macros** and reuse them anytime

---

## 🔄 Playback Logic

- Repeats recorded actions in order
- Supports:
  - ✔️ Fixed number of repetitions (e.g., 5x)
  - ♾️ Infinite loop mode (checkbox)
- 🔴 Playback can be stopped **immediately** by pressing the **`S` key**

| **Play Actions**    | Replays the currently recorded (or loaded) actions   |
| **Save to JSON**    | Saves recorded macro to a `.json` file               |
| **Load from JSON**  | Loads a previously saved `.json` macro               |
| **Repetitions**     | Field to define how many times the macro will run    |
| **Infinite Mode**   | Checkbox to run the macro infinitely                 |
| **Status / Cycle**  | Displays current status and current loop count       |

## 📜 Logging

Each session creates a log file in the `Logs/` folder, named using the current date: (example) Logs/19_06_2025.log

---

### Logs include:
- ✅ Recording & playback start/stop events  
- 💾 Macro saving and loading status  
- ⚠️ Any runtime errors or exceptions

---

## 🛡️ Safety First

- ⛔ Press **`S`** at any time to **immediately stop** playback
- 🔄 Playback runs on **background threads**, keeping the GUI responsive
- 🧯 Ensures you can **always regain control**, even during infinite loops

## 🧪 Roadmap (Ideas)

- [ ] ✏️ Edit macros visually within the GUI  
- [ ] 🕒 Timeline view of recorded actions  
- [ ] 🐢 Adjustable playback speed  
- [ ] 💻 CLI mode for headless automation  
- [ ] 🎲 Add randomness to mouse/key events for realism
