1. Application should have simple, easy to learn GUI.
2. Application should allow users to define some repeatable steps like:
    - clicking on a few different icons/buttons in defined order,
    - performing certain keyboard action (like entering login and password).
3. Application should have a possibility to save stored steps.

To do:
Fix handling special keys ex. space (currently clicker writes "space" instead of pressing one). Add logging.
